## Description

This repo contains the implementation of image super resolution models **SRResNet** (**S**uper **R**esolution **ResNet**) and SRGAN (**S**uper **R**esolution **GAN**) from scratch using DIV2K, Flickr2K datasets for training and Set5, Set14 datasets for testing. Click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) to find the paper. Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sharansmenon/div2k) to get DIV2K dataset on kaggle and download it. Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daehoyang/flickr2k) to get Flickr2K dataset on kaggle and download it. Testing datasets can both be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/SelfExSR).

The figure below is taken from the paper linked above and represents the architecture of SRGAN.
